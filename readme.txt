Hi Lars!

All the code for the project is in the bin folder, althogh we dont really have
any binary files. We wrote the project in Jupyter Notebook, so we hope that is
ok and that you have that installed. "bin/Peptides-HMM" contains the core of
the project and in "bin/help script" there are some code for helping with the
creation of sequence logos. If the notebook format is a no-go please let us know.

Regards
Felix and Ezeddin.


Step by step:

$ cd bin
$ jupyter notebook

Open the Peptides-HMM file in the browser window that should now have opened up.
