We have to day decided to try two approaches to the classification problem.
One: we use the states given in the training data to create two markow models,
one for the positive data and one for the negative data. We the use this model
to calculate the probability of the sequence we want to classify, if it is more
likely with the positive model, we classify it as positive, else it is
negative. Two: we are also going to try to train a neural network for the
classification problem. We are going to do this using an RNN(recurrent neural
network) with LSTM(long short-term memory) units. In the first step we are
going to disregard the data we have regarding the underlying statets and only
look at the binary classification problem. In a later stage we migth try to
train an ANN with the hidenstate data as target.

This model was trained without dropout and with an embedding layer that was probably unneccesary.
